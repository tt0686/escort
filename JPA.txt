	LAZY LOADING
		By default ManyToOne and OneToOne are eager !!!
		Because both just return one row from database!!!
	
	Entity Managers
		Persistence Unit is a named configuration of entity classes
		Persistence Context is a managed set of entity instances.
		EVERY PERSISTENCE CONTEXT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSISTENCE UNIT,RESTRICTING THE CLASSES OF THE MANAGED INSTANCES TO THE SET DEFINED BY THE PERSISTENCE UNIT.
		A ENTITY INSTANCE IS MANAGED MEANS THAT IS CONTAINED WITHIN A PERSISTENCE CONTEXT AND IT CAN BE ACTED UPON BY AN ENTITY MANAGER.
		
		IF THE PERSISTENCE CONTEXT PARTICIPATES IN A TRANSACTION, THE IN-MEMORY STATE OF THE MANAGED ENTITIES WILL GET SYNCHRONIZED TO THE DATABASE!
		
		
		CONTAINER MANAGED ENTITY MANAGER
			JTA(Transaction scoped)(Single Transaction)
				Every time an operation is invoked on the entity manager, the container proxy for that entity manager checks to see whether a persistence context is associated with the container JTA transaction. 
				If it finds one, the entity manager will use this persistence context. If it doesn’t find one, it creates a new persistence context and associates it with the transaction.
			EXTENDED(Scoped to the life of the stateful session bean)
			
			ALWAYS USE JTA TRANSACTIONS
		
		APPLICATION MANAGED ENTITY MANAGER
			Any entity manager that is created from the createEntityManager() call of an EntityManagerFactory instance, is what we call an application-managed entity manager.
			Application Managed Entity Manager are the only entity manager type available in Java SE!!!
			What separates Java SE and Java EE for application-managed entity managers is not how you create the entity manager but how you get the factory.
			In terms of the persistence context, the application-managed entity manager is similar to an extended container-managed entity manager!!!
			When an application-managed entity manager is created, it creates its own private persistence context that lasts until the entity manager is closed.
			The role of the application-managed entity manager in Java EE is somewhat specialized. 
			If resource-local transactions are required for an operation, an application-managed entity manager is the only type of entity manager that can be configured with that transaction type within the server.
			
			CAN USE JTA OR RESOURCE LOCAL TRANSACTIONS
			
			TRANSACTIONS DEFINE WHEN NEW, CHANGED, OR REMOVED ENTITIES ARE SYNCHRONIZED TO THE DATABASE.
			ALL PERSISTENCE CONTEXTS BEHAVE THE SAME WAY WHEN THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION.
			TWO TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS:
				RESOURCE LOCAL(Managed by the JDBC driver)
				JTA (Managed by the server)
				
			THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE PERSISTENCE CONTEXT ASSOCIATED WITH AND PROPAGATED ACROSS A JTA TRANSACTION. ALL CONTAINER-MANAGED ENTITY MANAGERS IN THE SAME TRANSACTION MUST SHARE THE SAME PROPAGATED PERSISTENCE CONTEXT.
			
			Two different beans
			
			@Stateless
			public class EmployeeService{
				@PersistenceContext(unitName="EmployeeService")
				EntityManager em;
				
				@EJB
				AuditService audit;
				
				public void createEmployee(Employee emp){
					em.persist(emp);
					audit.logTransaction(emp.getId(), "created employee");
					....
					
			@Stateless
			public class AuditService{
				@PersistenceContext(unitName="EmployeeService")
				EntityManager em;
				
				public void logTransaction(int empId, String action){
					if (em.find(Employee.class, empId) == null) {
						throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown employee id");
					}
					
		EVEN THOUGH THE NEWLY CREATED EMPLOYEE IS NOT YET IN THE DATABASE, THE AUDIT BEAN CAN FIND THE ENTITY AND VERIFY THAT IT EXISTS. THIS WORKS BECAUSE THE TWO BEANS ARE ACTUALLY SHARING THE SAME PERSISTENCE CONTEXT.
		Now consider the case where logTransaction() has been declared with the REQUIRES_NEW transaction attribute instead of the default REQUIRED. Before the logTransaction() method call starts, 
		the container will suspend the transaction inherited from createEmployee() and start a new transaction. When the find() method is invoked on the entity manager, it will check the current transaction for an
		active persistence context only to determine that one does not exist. A new persistence context will be created starting with the find() call, and this persistence context will be the active persistence 
		context for the remainder of the logTransaction() call. Because the transaction started in createEmployee() has not yet committed, the newly created Employee instance is not in the database and therefore 
		is not visible to this new persistence context. The find() method will return null, and the logTransaction() method will throw an exception as a result.
		
		PERSISTENCE CONTEXT INHERITANCE BETWEEN EXTENDED CONTAINER MANAGER!!!
		
		Application managed persistence context can by synchronized with JTA transactions BUT the persistence context will not by considered associated by any container managed entity manager.
		THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF APPLICATION MANAGED PERSISTENCE CONTEXTS THAT CAN BE SYNCHRONIZED WITH A TRANSACTION BUT ONLY ONE CONTAINER MANAGED PERSISTENCE CONTEXT WILL EVER BE ASSOCIATED!!!
		APPLICATION MANAGED ENTITY MANAGERS DO NOT PROPAGATE,THE ONLY WAY TO SHARE MANAGED ENTITIES WITH OTHER COMPONENTS IS TO SHARE THE ENTITY MANAGER ITSELF!!!
		
		Application Managed entity manager participates in JTA transactions in one of the two ways :
			1 : Persistence Context is created inside the transaction it will be automatically synchronized with the transaction
			2 : If created outside  the persistence context could be manually synchronized through the calling joinTransaction()
			
			@Stateful
			public class DepartmentManager {
				@PersistenceUnit(unitName="EmployeeService")
				EntityManagerFactory emf;
				EntityManager em;
				Department dept;
				
				public void init(int deptId) {    <- Created inside the transaction
					em = emf.createEntityManager();
					dept = em.find(Department.class, deptId);
				}
				public String getName() {
					return dept.getName();
				}
				public void addEmployee(int empId) {
					em.joinTransaction();    <- Must be joined !!!
					Employee emp = em.find(Employee.class, empId);
					...
					
			ENTITYMANAGERFACTORY INSTANCES ARE THREAD-SAFE
			ENTITYMANAGER INSTANCES ARE NOT.
			
			
			public class EmployeeServlet extends HttpServlet {
				@PersistenceUnit(unitName="EmployeeService")
				EntityManagerFactory emf;
				@Resource UserTransaction tx;   <-Must Use the manual transactions because the servlet is not a bean!!!
				
				protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
					// ...
					int id = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("id"));
					String name = request.getParameter("name");
					long salary = Long.parseLong(request.getParameter("salary"));
					tx.begin();
					EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();                  <- Created inside a transaction so it is synchronize automatically
					try {
						EmployeeService service = new EmployeeService(em);
						service.createEmployee(id, name, salary);
					} finally {
						em.close();   <- it could be closed before the transaction commits !!!
					}
						tx.commit();
					// ...
					}
				}
				
			Unsynchronized Persistence Contexts
				Besides the case of the application managed entity manager that starts outside of a transaction and that needs to be explicitly joined ir order to cause its managed entity changes to be transactionally
				committed.There is another persistence context option that exhibits similar behaviour.
				
				Container Managed
				@PersistenceContext(unitName="EmployeeService",synchronization=UNSYNCHRONIZED)
				EntityManager em;
				
				Application Managed
				@PersistenceUnit(unitName="EmployeeService")
				EntityManagerFactory emf;
				...
				EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager(UNSYNCHRONIZED);
				
				Neither of these persistence contexts will be synchronized with the JTA transaction unless they are explicitly joined using joinTransaction(). 
				Once joined to the transaction, they will remain joined until that transaction completes, but being joined to one transaction will not imply being joined to subsequent transactions.
				An unsynchronized persistence context must be explicitly joined to each and any transaction it wants to be enlisted in.
				
				Regardless of whether the persistence context has been joined to the transaction or not, the unsynchronized persistence context will be propagated when the JTA transaction is propagated. 
				There is, however, one exception to this rule for unsynchronized persistence contexts. An unsynchronized persistence context, regardless of whether it is joined or not, 
				is never propagated into a synchronized one.
				
			Resource Local Transactions
				Are controlled explicitly  by the appliction.The application interact with resource-local transactions by acquiring an implementation of the javax.persistence.EntityTransaction interface.
				Resource-local transactions in the Java EE environment might be for logging. 
				If your application requires an audit log stored in the database that must be written regardless of the outcome of any JTA transactions
				
			Transaction RollBack and Entity State
				JAVA MEMORY MODEL IS NOT TRANSACTIONAL!!!
				WE ARE BASICALLY LEFT WITH A BUNCH OF DETACHED ENTITY INSTANCES.
				
			Entity Manager Operations
				PERSIST -> Causes the new entity instance to become managed , if is already managed it is ignored.
				The actual SQL to create the necessary relational data will not be generated until the persistence context is synchronized with the database, typically only when the transaction commits.
				Application-managed and extended entity managers will accept the persist request, causing the entity to become managed, but no immediate action will be taken until a new transaction begins 
				and the persistence context becomes synchronized with the transaction.This queues up the change to happen at a later time. 
				It is only when the transaction commits that changes will be written out to the database.
				
					Department dept = em.find(Department.class, 30);
					Employee emp = new Employee();
					emp.setId(53);
					emp.setName("Peter");
					emp.setDepartment(dept);
					dept.getEmployees().add(emp);
					em.persist(emp);  <------------ Emp is the owner of the relationship(has the FK to the Department table) if we just added the Employee to the collection and not updated the other side
					                                of the relationship,nothing would have been persisted to the database.
													
				FIND returns a managed entity instance in all cases except when invoked outside of a transaction on a transaction-scoped entity manager.
				In this case, the entity instance is returned in a detached state. It is not associated with any persistence context.

				REMOVE
					Cascading operations
						CASCADE SETTINGS ARE UNIDIRECTIONAL!!!
						cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST/REMOVE/REFRESH/MERGE/DETACH
						
						REMOVE
							There are really only two cases in which cascading the remove() operation makes sense:
							one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, in which there is a clear parent-child relationship. 
							It can’t be blindly applied to all one-to-one and one-to-many relationships because the target entities might also be participating in other relationships or might make sense as 
							stand-alone entities. Care must be taken when using the REMOVE cascade option.
							
				CLEAR
					Simple detach all the entities from the persistence context, is similar in semantics to the ROLLBACK
					
				Synchronization with database
							PERSISTENCE CONTEXT
								emp:Employee-------------------addr:Address   DETACHED ENTITY FROM PREVIOUS TRANSACTION
								      |     |------------------phone1:Phone   NEW
									  \/    |------------------phone2:Phone   NEW
								ps:ParkingSpace
								
								
							Flushing the Emp instance above, the flush algorithm is look in the ps object, because is managed we do not have to do anything further.
                            The Phones are new , but because we use the cascade option we perform the equivalent of invoking persist() on each Phone.
							Finally the addr object is detached so we normally will through an exception,but this particular relationship is a special case in Flush Algorithm.
							Any time a detached object that is the target of the oneToOne or manyToOne relationship is encoutered where the source entity is the owner,the flush will still proceed 
							because the act of persisting the owning entity does not depend on the target.The owning entity has the foreign key column and needs to store only the primary key value of the target entity.
							
				MERGE
					em.merge(emp);
					emp.setLastAccessTime(new Date()); -> This modification it will not be written
					
					
					Employee managedEmp = em.merge(emp);
					emp.setLastAccessTime(new Date()); -> Now it will
					
					When merging if an entity instance with the same identifier already exists in the persistence context,the provider will overwrite its state with the state of the entity being merged and 
					the managed version that existed already must be returned, if the provider did not update the Employee instance in the persistence context,any references to that instance will become inconsistent
					with the new state being merged in.In the presence of relationships , the merge operation will attempt to update the managed entity to point to managed versions of the entities referenced by the 
					detached entity.Lazy-loading relationships are a special case in the merge operation. If a lazy-loading relationship was not triggered on an entity before it became detached, that relationship
					will be ignored when the entity is merged.
					
					Scenario
							Persistence Context
								addr1                     addr:
								id     = 100              id=100
								street = Jupiter          street = Urano
								     |                       |
								     |                    emp:Employee
								emp1                      id=10
								id=10                     name=Kurt
								name = John                  |
								                             |
								phone1:Phone<----------------|--------dept:
								id=20                                  id=30
								
								
								After the merge on "emp" , the "emp1" instance will be updated to the values of "emp"
								the emp1 will point to phone1 because is already managed
								the dep is not a managed entity , so the provider will find the dept with id 30 in the database and will be become one more instance in the persistence context
								Finally the addr1 is already managed so its not updated with the news values from "addr".
								THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE MERGE IS NOT ACTIVIDATED BY DEFAULT ON THE CASCADING.
								
				PLANNING FOR DETACHMENT
					1:Triggering Lazy loading methods by accessing the method
						the entity returned from a lazy-loading relationship can actually be a proxy that waits until a method is invoked on the proxy before the entity is faulted in. 
						We have to invoke a method on the entity to guarantee that it is actually retrieved from the database.
					2:Configuring Eager Loading
					3:Avoiding Detachment
						Two ways -> Use projection queries to retrieve only the entity state that will be displayed instead of retrieving full entity isntances.
									Keep persistence context open
										use User transactions plus transaction scope entity manager(Transaction View)
										Entity manager by request -> Application managed Entity manager
										Extended Persistence Context
										
				MERGING
					Facade Session
						WE NEED TO KEEP THE DETACHED INSTANCE AROUND IN ORDER TO PRESERVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS OR OTHER STATE THAT WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED BY THE EDIT. 
						CREATING A NEW EMPLOYEE INSTANCE AND SUPPLYING ONLY PARTIAL VALUES COULD HAVE MANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS WHEN THE INSTANCE IS MERGED.
						
					Edit Session
						By placing a stateful session bean in a central location such as the HTTP session, we can operate on entities managed by the extended entity manager without having to merge in order
						to persist changes.
					Conversation
						Unsynchronized Context
						
			Queries
				JPQL
					Query parameters
						Position
							?1
						Named
							:dept
							
					Three approaches to define a JPQL query:
						Dynamic queries are strings
							Many query engines will cache the translated SQL for later use, but this can easily be defeated if the application does not use parameter binding and concatenates parameter
							values directly into query strings.
							
							em.createQuery(QUERY, Long.class)
							
						Named queries are static and more efficient to execute because the persistence provider can translate the JPQL string to SQL once when the appplication starts
							@NamedQuery(name="findSalaryForNameAndDepartment",query="SELECT e.salary FROM Employee e WHERE e.department.name = :deptName AND e.name = :empName")
							
							em.createNamedQuery
							
							Dynamic Named Query
								TypeQuery<Long> q = em.createQuery(QUERY, Long.class);
								emf.addNamedQuery("findSalaryForNameAndDepartment", q);
								
					Query Parameters
						query="SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :dept
							Entity types may be used as parameters,the necessary primary key columns will be inserted into the conditional expression
							
					Executing queries
						Query and TypedQuery objects may be reused as often as needed so long  as the same persistence context that was used to create the query is still active.
						For transaction-scoped entity managers, this limits the lifetime of the Query or TypedQuery object to the life of the transaction. Other entity manager types may reuse them until the entity
						manager is closed or removed.
						
						WHENEVER AN ENTITY INSTANCE IS RETURNED, IT BECOMES MANAGED BY THE ACTIVE PERSISTENCE CONTEXT. 
						IF THAT ENTITY INSTANCE IS MODIFIED AND THE PERSISTENCE CONTEXT IS PART OF A TRANSACTION, THE CHANGES WILL BE PERSISTED TO THE DATABASE. 
						THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS THE USE OF TRANSACTION-SCOPED ENTITY MANAGERS OUTSIDE OF A TRANSACTION. 
						ANY QUERY EXECUTED IN THIS SITUATION RETURNS DETACHED ENTITY INSTANCES INSTEAD OF MANAGED ENTITY INSTANCES. 
						TO MAKE CHANGES ON THESE DETACHED ENTITIES, THEY MUST FIRST BE MERGED INTO A PERSISTENCE CONTEXT BEFORE THEY CAN BE SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE DATABASE.	
						A consequence of the long-term management of entities with application-managed and extended persistence contexts is that executing large queries will cause
						the persistence context to grow as it stores all the managed entity instances that are returned. 
						If many of these persistence contexts are holding onto large numbers of managed entities for long periods of time, then memory use may become a concern.
						
					Optimizing Read-Only queries
						When the query results will not be modified, queries using transaction-scoped entity managers outside of a transaction can be more efficient than queries executed within
						a transaction when the result type is an entity. When query results are prepared within a transaction, the persistence provider has to take steps to convert the results intmanaged entities. 
						This usually entails taking a snapshot of the data for each entity in order to have a baseline to compare against when the transaction is committed. 
						If the managed entities are never modified, the effort of converting the results into managed entities is wasted.
						When encapsulating query operations behind a bean with container-managed transactions, the easiest way to execute nontransactional queries is to use the NOT_SUPPORTED transaction 
						attribute for the session bean method.
						
					Special Result Types
						Whenever a query involves more than one expression in the SELECT clause, the result of the query will be a List of Object arrays.

							public void displayProjectEmployees(String projectName) {
								List result = em.createQuery("SELECT e.name, e.department.name FROM Project p JOIN p.employees e WHERE p.name = ?1 ORDER BY e.name").setParameter(1, projectName).getResultList();
								int count = 0;
								for (Iterator i = result.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
									Object[] values = (Object[]) i.next();
									System.out.println(++count + ": " +values[0] + ", " + values[1]);
								}
							}
							
							Constructor expressions provide developers with a way to map an array of Object result types to custom objects.
							A constructor expression is defined in JP QL using the NEW operator in the SELECT clause.
							The argument to the NEW operator is the fully qualified name of the class that will be instantiated to hold the results for each row of data returned.
							
							List<EmpMenu> result = em.createQuery("SELECT NEW example.EmpMenu(e.name, e.department.name) FROM Project p JOIN p.employees e WHERE p.name = ?1 ORDER BY e.name", EmpMenu.class)
							.setParameter(1, projectName).getResultList();
							
					Query Paging
						The Query and TypedQuery interfaces provide support for pagination via the setFirstResult() and setMaxResults() methods. 
						These methods specify the first result to be received (numbered from zero) and the maximum number of results to return relative to that point.
						
				Criteria API
