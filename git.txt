GIT
	Store data as snapshots of the project over time
	SVN
		Store data as changes to a base version of each file
		
	GIT as Integrity
		Everything in GIT is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by the checksum.
		This means it is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.
		
	Three States that our files can reside in !!!
		1 Committed (Safely stored in the database)
		2 Modified  (Changed but not commited)
		3 Staged    (Modified file marked to go into our next commit snapshot)
			This take us to the three main sections of a Git project
				Git Directory (Where Git stores the metadata and object database for our project, it is what is copied when we clone a repository from another computer)
				Working Directory (Is a single checkout of one version of our project.)
				Staging area (Is a file,generally contained in our Git repository that stores information about what will go into out next commit)
		
	 Start to track an existing project 		
		git init			
			Creates a subdirectory named .git
		To start version controlling existing files
			git add *.c
			git add LICENSE
			git commit -m "initial project version"
	  
     Cloning and Existing Repository
		git clone
			Is clone and not checkout because is not just the working copy but is a full copy of nearly all data  that the server as.
